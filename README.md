Just a Ham Hamming Around the Air and the Internet

This is a test page to see if I like Jeykll.

I’ve been a radio operator since 1999. I met and became friends with many people in Central Arkansas, and participated in Skywarn and other public events. In 2004 I upgraded to General class and have since upgraded to Extra. We moved to Texas in 2005 and did not become nearly as active as I was when I was in Arkansas at first. Lately, I have become very active. I am a W5YI-VEC and ARRL-VEC VE and am available for testing with a little notice. I can be found on a few repeaters in North TX:

    442.8250 – BedfordARC 440 Repeater
    147.1000 – HurstARC Primary 2m Repeater
    442.8500 – HurstARC 440 Repeater
    Hurst, TX DMR Repeaters, HurstARC or Texas Statewide.
    GMRS Channels

During Skywarn/Emergencies I will occasionally participate in Hurst ARES/RACES nets.

I really enjoy 20 and 40 meters. I use LoTW as my primary, eQSL as my secondary, and logs are uploaded every day as part of my shutdown routine. I would like to request that you just confirm our QSO in LoTW and/or eQSL. I try to confirm every QSO I receive. I’ve found myself more and more on DMR digital since Fusion seems to be at a standstill and not really exciting because of it. I really like DMR and the people on there. I manage the DMRTexas.net website, which is a place for all things DMR in the Republic of Texas.

I was elected as the Hurst Amateur Radio Club President in 2015 and did that for four years which I enjoyed a lot, but have turned that over to my friend John, K5SKR, and now my friend Paul, W5PFH. We have a great group of people. If you are ever in the DFW area on Saturday morning, come meet with us.
